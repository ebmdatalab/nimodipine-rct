<p><b>We wrote to you last month to tell you that your practice was
  one of the 20% highest prescribing practices for broad spectrum
  antibiotics over the last six months in England.</b></p>

<p>GP practices have used similar feedback to reduce their
  overall antibiotic prescribing rate by 3.3%[1]. Please email us
  at hello@op2.org.uk if you would like to share any changes you
  have made in response to this feedback â€” we would be very
  interested in hearing about them.</p>

<p>We understand these drugs should be prescribed in some situations,
  and that it can be difficult to refuse them to patients who ask for
  them.</p>
