<p class="about-op">OpenPrescribing is a free, publicly-funded service
  created by researchers in the University of Oxford to make national
  prescribing data more useful. You can see the performance of your
  practice on various prescribing measures, look at any practice or
  CCG in the country, and do bespoke data searches on any treatment of
  interest.</p>
