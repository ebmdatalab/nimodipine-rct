  <p>OpenPrescribing is a free, publicly funded service to make the
  national GP prescribing data more useful. We have graphs and data
  on all prescribing at {{ practice_name }} online and viewable by
  anybody at this link:
  {{ intervention_url }}.</p>
  <p>Your practice was in the top 20% of practices for prescribing
  a high proportion of broad spectrum antibiotics based upon the
  latest available six months of data.</p>
  <p>This chart shows how your practice compares to other practices
  on % antibiotics prescribed which were broad spectrum:</p>

  <p>Broad spectrum antibiotics (co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins</p>
  <p>and quinolones) must be used sparingly to avoid drug-resistant
  bacteria developing.</p>
  <p>See more on your prescribing data online at this link:
  {{ intervention_url }}. You can see your
  practice's performance on various prescribing measures, and do
  bespoke data searches on any treatment of interest. You can also
  view the prescribing of your neighbours, and any practice or CCG
  in the country.</p>
  <p>These are intended as helpful indications - we appreciate that
  there are many reasons to prescribe different drugs in certain
  cases.</p>
