  <p>We wrote to you last month to tell you that your practice was
  one of the 20% highest prescribing practices for broad spectrum
  antibiotics over the last six months in England.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>GP practices have used similar feedback to reduce their
  overall antibiotic prescribing rate by 3.3%[1]. Please email us
  at hello@op2.org.uk if you would like to share any changes you
  have made in response to this feedback - we would be very
  interested in hearing about them.</p>

  <p>As a reminder, here is how {{ practice_name }} compares to other
  practices for broad spectrum antibiotic prescriptions such as
  co-amoxiclav, cephalosporins and quinolones as a percentage of
  all antibiotics:</p>
  <p>We understand these drugs should be prescribed in some
  situations, and that it can be difficult to refuse them to
  patients who ask for them.</p>
